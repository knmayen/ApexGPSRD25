Plan: 
Use phones connected to strava to track each roll for each driver
have push captains take pusher data and send to me 
after rolls, upload the strava and pusher data to the interface
get the splits for each pusher
somehow create a library for the push capitans to look at where they can sort by pusher division/hill times

UI needs:
probably a pusher library

what i need to research:
- DATA STRUCTURES
    - each pusher is a dictionary with the keys as hills, and a list of sets with date and time? 
    - can dictionaries have properties? this could be 
    - pusher class
    - name <- object
    - division <- property
    - hill times <- each hill is its own property, and they are a set of sets of {time, date, roll #}
        - can I do this? I should know that <- i think i can as long as i dont try to mutate them
- I can just use that site for gpx -> txt, but it might be fun to figure out how to read it myself
- also how do I get data to save
    - pickling im pretty sure, but where does the data actually save?
- github?
    - if i do this in github, can all of the data be saved in a txt file for the classes?
    - wait i figured out the inital part of github lets goooooooo
- other python graphics packages
- how to actually get pip working

current plan:
- use the site for gpx -> txt 
    - https://www.gpsvisualizer.com/convert_input
- figure out how to read the txt file
- drawing lines for gps
- I want to use a graphics package that is not cmu_graphics


backend: upload txt file -> assign it to the driver, pushers, day -> code reads it, finds the splits -> code saves pusher splits and data
frontend: driver mode -> get all lines on a map, be able to see speed for each line (this will be second)
        push captain mode -> be able to look for hill times, freeroll times, sort hill times by division,
            - there will need to be pusher profiles (name, division), can this be done in an excel sheet? it might be easier

possible issues:
- this runs on our cellphones, so maybe we get the drivers to have thier own strava on thier phones that I can connect to mine?
    - katrina without zello all rolls is unideal

- can strava take multiple sessions at the same time? 
    - maybe then each driver has an account that is on their phone and my computer <- ith this is the solution

- where are the drivers going to put the phones?
    - brooklyn had it in her sleeve, i'm not sure that was comfortable
    - gaff tape in the nose?
    - taping them to the backs of the harnesses?
    - this might just be a personal preference

- how is the pusher data input going to look? 
    - initially an excel file with name and division
    - could edit the txt files to include the pusher names at the top <- this might be the most coherernt

- also I should get new mechs involved
