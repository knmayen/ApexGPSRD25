# ApexGPSRD25
 a test project for apex buggy in using phone gps for pusher data for RD25

initially made by ass head katrina mayen during winter break 24-25

objective:
The user can input pusher data, and .txt files that include gps data for each roll (aka lap). The user can then
assign pushers, a driver, and a buggy to the roll, and save the roll to compute the pusher time splits and other
helpful data, which is also then assigned to each pusher. The user can then see the visualization of each roll on
the maps, and can see pusher times and sort by division and best times. 
Having more accurate pusher data will create a safer driver experiance, because having accurate pusher information
can decrease the risk of crashes due to poor heat selection choices. Also, more accurate pusher data can drive push
team formation to yield the fastest teams. 

1/2 Updates:
All testing data is not at CMU due to time constraints. Pittsburgh testing data will be input in the middle of 
January.
